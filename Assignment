Inspired by rugged backpacks, it quickly became the trusted guardian of digital memories.

Prerequisites: 
A Vagrant VM with local folder syncing capability set up.

Activity 1:
Objective: Create a media files backup service.
Task: Develop a shell script named `bkmedia.sh` to manage backups of media files from multiple sources.
Details:
    A file named `locations.cfg` will store server locations in the format: `[user]@[server host]:[path]`.

Script functionalities:
Running without arguments: Display configured locations, preceded by line numbers.
Backup:
Run with `-B`: Initiates backups for all locations.
Use `-L n` with `-B`: Initiates backup only for the specific location by line number `n`.
Restore:
Run with `-R n`: Indicates which backup (from the most recent) to restore.
Use `-L n` with `-R`: Designates which location to restore from.
Note on SSH keys: Ensure the executing user's public SSH key is set up on servers you intend to back up.
 
Activity 2 (Optional): 
Objective: Enhance the backup service in terms of performance and cost-efficiency.
Task: Propose design alterations to the existing setup. Address performance bottlenecks and devise strategies to reduce data storage costs.
Details: 
    - Consider backup speed optimizations.
    - Explore data compression, deduplication, or other data optimization techniques.
    - Outline the specific changes to be integrated into your current solution based on your new design.
 
Submission: Share your scripts and design documents through Teams.  Documents and Code should come via GitHub links.
All open questions can be asked in our weekly sessions. All other questions can be asked to your assigned senior apprentice over teams.
